- Finally had time to get back to work on this project


12/1/2024
- Edited board shape to integrate battery into center, to reduce thickness significantly. Battery capacity went from 2000mAH to 400mAH : Current projected battery life with normal usage is ~4 days. (full load being ~8.4 hours)
  (this was calculated with rough and pessimistic values so true battery life can easily be more (50mA at 3.3v, when battery provides between 4.2v and 3.2v - and once again, using excessive power consumption values)
- Replaced BN180 and HC05 modules with MAX-M10S and DA14531 respectivley, saving space and providing more accurate measurments as well as far lower theoretical power consumption.
  -> Both chips now use external antennas, connected via a UFL connector, allowing for a metal case without concerns of signal blocking.

-MAX-M10S functions on the same interface as the BN180 (UART0)
-DA14531 uses the UART1 interface, and is connected in such a manner that the RP2040 is able to program the chip over UART.

-Exposed debugging interfaces of RP2040 and DA14531 via pads in case they are needed in developpement.

12/3/24
-Had time again to progress on the design
-Replaced a few 0603 capacitors and some pull-ups with 0402 for space saving reasons
-Situatied BMS circuit under usb-connector, charge circuit on opposing side of board

12/5/24
-Minor progress

12/10/24
-Major progress :
  Board design settled (optimized capacitor sizes to mostly 0402 for space saving)
  Started transfering schematic to a new file to have a cleaner sheet.
  Final board layout begun

12/11/24 
-Start of majoir component placement, completion of clean sheet.
-> Need to replace some designators and change 0603 caps to 0402 if requirments allow

12/15/24
- More routing
- Charge circuit successfully situated

12/16/24
- General routing and component placement
- RF circuits situated with far more convenient antenna placement
- ! USB line routing is not the preffered option - to be revised as board progress moves on
- > 2 more sensors to be placed and routed, as well as all main traces and signal traces, as well as placing passives.

1/9/25 
- Board design complete, awaiting personal verification before ordering

1/10/25
- Added BOM to repo

2/11/25 
 - received pcbs and components, spent a week troubleshooting, now have a working board.
PMS leaves much to be desired, as the board runs hot when charging and with a full screen backlight, as well as an inability to fully turn off the screen.
Gps, max30100, screen are confirmed working, need to confirm magnometer, bme 680, SD card, and ble system, as well as troubleshooting pms and charging circuts
